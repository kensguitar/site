            <p>Hi, my name is Ken Klassen. I started playing guitar age 14.
            I loved blues at that time. My guitar heroes were B.B King, Eric Clapton,
            Carlos Santana, Jimi Hendrix, etc... but I also teach other genres
            such as country, rock, folk, etc...</p>

            <p>I have been playing guitar for over 40 years and have played in
               country, rock, and gospel blues bands.</p>

            <p>I have taught many people over those years. I love to pass on
                the talent of playing the guitar. I am presently using the Fast
                Track method but will customize lessons to suit the individual.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>What is a good age to start Guitar lessons?</dt>
                <dd>Everyone is different, but I generally recommend starting
                    at 8 years or older.</dd>

                <dt>Do you teach adults?</dt>
                <dd>Yes whether you are 8 or eighty, Guitar is very good therapy,
                    physically and emotionally.</dd>

                <dt>Is it best to start on acoustic or electric guitar?</dt>
                <dd>I feel it is best to start on the acoustic as it develops
                    stronger hands and fingers. If you are 8 years old, I would
                    recommend three quarter size guitar. Some people prefer the
                    electric guitar because they feel it is easier to press the
                    strings and “sounds cool”.</dd>

                <dt>Do I need to learn to read music?</dt>
                <dd>I feel it is good to be able to read basic notes or tablature,
                    so you get to know how and where they are played on the guitar.
                    However I do have a program designed for just learning to
                    strum and play chords.</dd>

                <dt>How do I pay for lessons?</dt>
                <dd>Students pay monthly at the beginning of each month by cash
                    or cheque. I offer weekly 30 min lessons at $20.00 per session.
                    (note that some months have 5 lessons)</dd>
