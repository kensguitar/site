        <p>Hi, my name is Ken Klassen, and I love to pass on the talent of playing the
            guitar. I've taught many guitarists over my 40 years on the instrument,
            and I'm currently accepting new students at my studio in Chilliwack, BC.</p>

        <p>I started playing guitar at age 14, and my heroes were B.B. King,
            Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, and Jimi Hendrix. While I was initially
            drawn to blues and rock, I now play and teach country, folk,
            gospel, and other genres as well.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>What kind of instructional material do you use?</dt>
                <dd>I use and recommend the Fast Track series (see some
                    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/FastTrack-Guitar-Method-Book-1/dp/0793573998#revMHLContainer">online reviews</a>). However, I will customize lessons and
                    materials as needed to suit each student.</dd>

                <dt>What is a good age to start Guitar lessons?</dt>
                <dd>Everyone is different, but I generally recommend starting
                    at 8 years or older.</dd>

                <dt>Do you teach adults?</dt>
                <dd>Yes! Whether you are 8 or 88, Guitar is great fun and very
                    good therapy, both physically and emotionally.</dd>

                <dt>Is it best to start on acoustic or electric guitar?</dt>
                <dd>I recommend starting on the acoustic, as it develops
                    stronger hands and fingers. Moving to the electric
                    guitar later (if desired) is easier as a result. However,
                    I'm happy to teach beginners on the electric if that's their
                    strong preference.

                    <p>Also, if you're under the age of 10, I recommend starting with a
                    three-quarter size guitar.</p></dd>

                <dt>Do I need to learn to read music?</dt>
                <dd>I feel it is good to be able to read basic notes or tablature,
                    so you get to know how and where they are played on the guitar.
                    However I do have a program designed for just learning to
                    strum and play chords.</dd>

                <dt>How do I pay for lessons?</dt>
                <dd>Students pay monthly (at the beginning of each month) by cash
                    or cheque. I offer weekly 30 minute lessons at $20 per session–
                    note that some months will have 5 sessions.</dd>
